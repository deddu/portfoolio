Sensible CSS Image Captions

See all the details at [captionss.com](http://captionss.com).

## Usage

There is an issue open for migrating some documentation from
[captionss.com](http://captionss.com) for those that don't feel like
clicking through. I will get on that as soon as possible. In the meantime,
well, you know where to find it.

## Contributing

I would love for the community to contribute to this project, but until I
figure out guidelines for doing so, it might be best to just submit an issue
to kick off a discussion about your potential contribution.

If you do happen to submit a pull request, I won't hold it against you.
